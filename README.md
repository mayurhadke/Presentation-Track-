The History of Credit Card 

The history of credit cards dates back to the 1920s, when some U.S. companies, particularly in the oil and hotel industries, began issuing cards to loyal customers for convenient purchases. These early forms of credit cards were limited to specific businesses. A major development came in 1950 with the introduction of the Diners Club card, recognized as the first modern, universal credit card that could be used at multiple establishments. Building on this innovation, in 1958, Bank of America launched the BankAmericard in California, which became the first bank-issued revolving credit card, allowing users to carry a balance over time. These milestones laid the foundation for the widespread use of credit cards today.
