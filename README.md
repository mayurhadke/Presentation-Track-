\About Credit Card\ 
A credit card is a payment tool issued by banks or financial institutions that allows users to borrow money up to a certain limit to make purchases or pay bills. Unlike debit cards, which use money directly from your bank account, credit cards let you spend first and pay later, usually by the end of a monthly billing cycle. If the full amount isn't paid on time, interest is charged on the remaining balance. Credit cards offer convenience, rewards, and build credit history, but they must be used responsibly to avoid debt.

\Background Process when an individual swipes the card\ 
When an individual swipes (or taps/inserts) a credit card, thereâ€™s a whole background process that happens in just a few seconds. Hereâ€™s a clear breakdown of what goes on behind the scenes:

ðŸ”„ Step-by-Step Background Process of a Credit Card Transaction
1. Card Swiped/Inserted/Tapped
The cardholder gives their card to the merchant or taps it at a terminal.

The terminal reads the cardâ€™s information (card number, expiry date, chip data).

2. Authorization Request
The merchant's Point of Sale (POS) machine sends the transaction details (amount, card info) to their Acquiring Bank (the merchant's bank).
The Acquirer forwards this request to the Card Network (Visa, Mastercard, etc.).

3. Communication with Issuer
The Card Network sends the request to the Issuer Bank (the bank that gave the card to the customer).

The Issuer checks:

Is the card valid?

Does the customer have enough credit limit?

Is the transaction suspicious or possibly fraudulent?

4. Authorization Response
The Issuer sends back a response: Approved or Declined.This response goes through the Card Network and Acquirer, back to the POS machine. If approved, the merchant gives the product/service to the customer.

5. Transaction Hold (Temporary)
The approved amount is placed on hold from the customerâ€™s credit limit. It hasnâ€™t been transferred yetâ€”just reserved.

6. Clearing and Settlement (Happens Later)
At the end of the day (or batch time), the merchant sends all transactions to the Acquirer.
The Acquirer sends them through the Card Network to the Issuer.
Settlement happens: Money moves from the Issuer to the Acquirer, and finally to the merchantâ€™s bank account.

ðŸ’¡ Summary:
Swipe â†’ Authorization â†’ Approval â†’ Product given â†’ Later Settlement

This entire process takes 2â€“4 seconds, even though there are multiple parties involved.
