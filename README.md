# Presentation-Track-
In this repository we (Mayur, Sanket,Tushar, Aryan and Anwarul) are doing the presentation work . 


In today's meet (07 April 2025 ) we sit together and discussed about the presentations and divided sub topics among us. We have already decided the topic i.e. How do credit card transactions work ? before 2 days. 


"Anwarul"(Basically, I will be explain about,
Diffrent types of fees in credit card transactions Assesssment fees, Interchange Fees, Merchant discount rate.

How bank and card networks makes money , why all cards cost are not same like why credit cards have higher fees than debit cards.

How premium card cost merchants more.

How it impact on small businesess- There is a minimum amount purchase setup for cards or any additinal charges for the usage of cards by small businesses.

Then i will  explaining why all of this is important to know how these small costs affect our payment and Why people use diffrent type of payments like cash.

I will use simple examples to explain credit card system function.


"MD ARYAAN"(Security and Fraud prevention mechanisms)

Subtopics that i'll be covering are:

i)Encryption, tokenization, and CVV/CVC verification: Techniques used to secure sensitive information, how each technique is used and payment security applications.

ii)3D Secure, similar to One-Time Passwords (OTP) verification: an extra layer of security on online transactions. The OTP verification procedure helps in preventing fraudulent transactions.

iii)EMV chip vs. magnetic stripe vs. contactless (NFC) transactions: EVM chip, Magnetic stripe and Contactless transaction(NFC) comparison.

iv)Typical fraud types (card-not-present, phishing, skimming) and countermeasures: Fraud techniques and ways to minimize them.

v)Why it matters: Emphasizes the trust infrastructure for safe use: The effect of security controls and its significance.

\About Credit Card\ 
A credit card is a payment tool issued by banks or financial institutions that allows users to borrow money up to a certain limit to make purchases or pay bills. Unlike debit cards, which use money directly from your bank account, credit cards let you spend first and pay later, usually by the end of a monthly billing cycle. If the full amount isn't paid on time, interest is charged on the remaining balance. Credit cards offer convenience, rewards, and build credit history, but they must be used responsibly to avoid debt.

\Background Process when an individual swipes the card\ 
When an individual swipes (or taps/inserts) a credit card, thereâ€™s a whole background process that happens in just a few seconds. Hereâ€™s a clear breakdown of what goes on behind the scenes:

ðŸ”„ Step-by-Step Background Process of a Credit Card Transaction
1. Card Swiped/Inserted/Tapped
The cardholder gives their card to the merchant or taps it at a terminal.

The terminal reads the cardâ€™s information (card number, expiry date, chip data).

2. Authorization Request
The merchant's Point of Sale (POS) machine sends the transaction details (amount, card info) to their Acquiring Bank (the merchant's bank).
The Acquirer forwards this request to the Card Network (Visa, Mastercard, etc.).

3. Communication with Issuer
The Card Network sends the request to the Issuer Bank (the bank that gave the card to the customer).

The Issuer checks:

Is the card valid?

Does the customer have enough credit limit?

Is the transaction suspicious or possibly fraudulent?

4. Authorization Response
The Issuer sends back a response: Approved or Declined.This response goes through the Card Network and Acquirer, back to the POS machine. If approved, the merchant gives the product/service to the customer.

5. Transaction Hold (Temporary)
The approved amount is placed on hold from the customerâ€™s credit limit. It hasnâ€™t been transferred yetâ€”just reserved.

6. Clearing and Settlement (Happens Later)
At the end of the day (or batch time), the merchant sends all transactions to the Acquirer.
The Acquirer sends them through the Card Network to the Issuer.
Settlement happens: Money moves from the Issuer to the Acquirer, and finally to the merchantâ€™s bank account.

ðŸ’¡ Summary:
Swipe â†’ Authorization â†’ Approval â†’ Product given â†’ Later Settlement

This entire process takes 2â€“4 seconds, even though there are multiple parties involved.

Future Trends and Challenges in Credit Card Systems

As we know, the credit card industry is a significantly transforming industry that has been experiencing rapid technological advancement. Consumer expectations are one key feature that should be addressed in the future, so I am going to talk about the future trends and challenges in the credit card industry.
As we are heading towards a contactless and digital payment system. The credit card industry is using the NFC(near-field communication) technology is becoming the norm for making in-store transactions due to its high speed and convenience.


However, in today's world, where security is the main concern, credit cards are evolving to be relevant, secure, and trusted by some consumers. As we know, the hacking of our personal information on the internet is a big phenomenon in todayâ€™s digital world. The credit card is somewhat of a safe option because fewer stolen cases and a smoother, safer user experience in this mobile and contactless payment world. Mostly developed countries use credit cards for making transactions. 
As the credit card offers an interest-free period(usually 20-50 days), which means you can pay later without extra cost. And also give reward points & cashback, and other discounts for consumers. It also gives purchase protection, insurance, and extended warranty. 
It also has higher spending limits and emergency funds for big purchases. One of the main advantages is that the credit cards are widely accepted globally, which is useful for travel in foreign countries. It also provides the option of buy now and pay later(BNPL), which offers a flexible payment option.

AI use in Credit Card Systems to  minimize the risk


AI and machine learning are revolutionizing credit card fraud detection by analyzing real-time transaction patterns and user behavior, making systems far more effective than traditional rule-based methods. Unlike rigid systems that simply block foreign transactions or large purchases, AI assesses multiple factorsâ€”such as spending history, location, purchase timing, and device usageâ€”to distinguish between legitimate and fraudulent activity. 
For example, if a user who typically spends in Mumbai suddenly buys a laptop in Germany, AI checks if they recently booked a flight there instead of outright declining the transaction. It also detects subtle fraud attempts, like micro-transactions used to test stolen cards, and prevents "friendly fraud" by verifying purchase authenticity through device and location data. Additionally, AI stops automated bot attacks by identifying rapid, abnormal transaction patterns. 
By reducing false declinesâ€”such as wrongly blocking a hotel booking abroad when the user has a travel historyâ€”AI enhances both security and customer experience. Major players like Mastercard, Visa, and leading banks now use AI-driven systems to combat fraud dynamically, ensuring safer transactions while minimizing disruptions for legitimate users.  


Challenges faced by credit cards 



Digital wallets that we use in our daily life to make transactions for commodities such as Apple Pay and Google Pay. This allows user to store multiple payment methods securely to make transactions on their smartphones and other devices such as smartwatches by the use of UPI(Unified Payments Interface). This is one of the big challenges faced by the credit card industry, and also the virtual cards, where we save our card information in our smartphones and use that for buying anything on e-commerce websites. Which is one of the main reasons for the elimination of physical cards is the rising concern towards credit cards. Both are fast, low-cost, and simple for making transactions. If you pay by virtual card, it gets faster than putting your information in again and again.
